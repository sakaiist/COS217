# testmywcdiff is a testing script for the mywc program.
# To run it, issue the command "./testmywcdiff somefile ",
# where somefile is the name of an input file.
#
# To use it, the working directory must contain:
# (1) mywcc, an executable binary file built from mywc.c, and
# (2) mywcs, an executable binary file built from mywc.s
#
# The script runs the mywcs program and the mywcc program on the
# specified file, and makes sure that the two programs have the
# same exit status and write the same characters to stdout.
#---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Validate the argument.
